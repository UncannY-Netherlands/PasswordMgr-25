LibreNova License (LNL) v1.1

Preamble

The LibreNova License (LNL) v1.1 is designed to protect and promote open-source software while preventing monopolization and closed-source exploitation. It ensures that software remains open, adaptable, and available to developers and users alike. The LibreNova Foundation (LNF) endorses this license to guarantee that at least 35% of a project remains open-source while enabling sustainable software development models.
